============
Installation
============

The library has not been uploaded to Pypi yet, so, for the time being can only be installed by source.

At the command line::

    $ git clone https://github.com/BhattiMarry/AddressBook
    $ cd AddressBook
    $ python setup.py install 

Use `sudo` before the last command or run the command by a sudo user.

For a quick check of the API installation, run:

    $ python
    
    >> import addressbook

If no error was generated, the API installed corectly. If you see any `ImportError` look at the installation log to see any errors during installation.
